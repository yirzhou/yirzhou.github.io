      <description>Yet another Christmas, but it is the last Christmas I will be having in Canada. This year&amp;rsquo;s Christmas obviously feels drastically different from the others because of the current world we live in, and I want to capture the feelings I have right now, in case I want to refer back in the future.
Perfect snow This Christmas actually feels like a Christmas in terms of the weather - it started snowing on Christmas Eve and will probably keep snowing for a couple of days.</description>

      <description>This is one of the most valuable skills that I learned in my current internship. We all love VSCode but this just blew me away.
 1. Motivation As a software engineer working with various languages and their ecosystems, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to mess up your development machine when installing dependencies directly on it. Even when we just want to try out a new language, we still need to have that language runtime installed somewhere on our system.</description>

      <description>This is my first ever article on this site, which means that I&amp;rsquo;m just as new to it as you are ðŸ™‚.
Some history I&amp;rsquo;ve had this idea of writing random stuff down for quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had two failed attempts in the past.
My first attempt was a WordPress site with a paid hosting service. It was my very first entry into content management. However, I found WordPress too much overkill for my use as there are a lot of features that I never used.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Yiren, and I also go by Larry. I am a 4th-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo, although I&amp;rsquo;ll be graduating soon in April 2021 ðŸ˜ƒ.
I consider myself a weird tech nerd: I don&amp;rsquo;t play games (any more) but I know pretty much everything about the latest CPU and GPU releases; I don&amp;rsquo;t own any cutting-edge tech products, but I try to keep myself updated with their unique features.</description>
