      <description>After today&amp;rsquo;s FSE exam, it officially wraps up my experience in the course Foundations of Software Engineering. As the most important course, or the &amp;ldquo;bread-and-butter&amp;rdquo; of the Software Engineering program, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d summarize what I learned from taking the course, both in terms of the technical and the non-technical aspects.
Background in FSE The course, titled as &amp;ldquo;Foundations of Software Engineering&amp;rdquo;,supposedly teaches the students the fundamentals of the subject. In my opinion, it mostly fulfills this objective because it takes a very hands-on approach.</description>
