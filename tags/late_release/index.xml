      <description>The final term at school has been tough to say the least because:
I am taking seven courses. I am missing home too much. I have been rejected by three grad schools that I applied to. Physically, I am not in a good shape. The first two reasons can be coped fairly easily by: studying harder and sleeping less, and distracting myself by reading and watching interesting stuff.
The third reason, however, makes me feel like there could be something inherently wrong with myself.</description>
