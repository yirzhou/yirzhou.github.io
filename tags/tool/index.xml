      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been three weeks since my last post. Taking seven courses in a term isn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest thing to do&amp;hellip; I struggled a bit at the beginning of the term because all the tasks and deadlines were just overwhelming.
However, recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started doing something that I used to do and that&amp;rsquo;s made me feel so good about myself. That is: using a TODO app.
I know it sounds incredibly boring to pretty much everyone.</description>
