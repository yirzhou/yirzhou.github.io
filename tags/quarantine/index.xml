      <description>While you are reading this post, I have probably been in quarantine for several days. Yes! I&amp;rsquo;m home, but in a hotel for now.
I have a lot of ideas that I want to work on. I&amp;rsquo;m not disclosing any of them, but the gist is that by realizing those ideas, I get to experience the same workflow as before but in a different country with some internet censorships. I will have to naturally get through them if I want to work in the same way as before.</description>
