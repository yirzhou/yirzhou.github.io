      <description>This is my first ever article on this site, which means that I&amp;rsquo;m just as new to it as you are ðŸ™‚.
Some history I&amp;rsquo;ve had this idea of writing random stuff down for quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had two failed attempts in the past.
My first attempt was a WordPress site with a paid hosting service. It was my very first entry into content management. However, I found WordPress too much overkill for my use as there are a lot of features that I never used.</description>
