      <description>This is just a quick statement that starting from this moment (i.e. 2021-04-06 11:30:00 PM), I will stop complaining, whining, and expressing any negative energy.
I have been facing tremendous challenges. Some problems are those others might refer to as &amp;ldquo;first-world&amp;rdquo; problems, but they are definitely not fun to deal with. They have sucked up a significant amount of my time and energy - I&amp;rsquo;m basically burned out at this point.</description>

      <description>The final term at school has been tough to say the least because:
 I am taking seven courses. I am missing home too much. I have been rejected by three grad schools that I applied to. Physically, I am not in a good shape.  The first two reasons can be coped fairly easily by: studying harder and sleeping less, and distracting myself by reading and watching interesting stuff.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been hell of a year&amp;hellip; damn!
I have envisioned a very different year for 2020 back in 2019 - 2020 was supposed to be normal and balanced (again, like all things should be), and yet we had this: a year that might&amp;rsquo;ve already led us into a completely different future. I have come across this thought multiple times: when everything goes back to normal, the perfect term that describes that feeling would be: post-apocalyptic.</description>

      <description>This is my first ever article on this site, which means that I&amp;rsquo;m just as new to it as you are :slightly_smiling_face:.
   Some history  I&amp;rsquo;ve had this idea of writing random stuff down for quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had two failed attempts in the past.
My first attempt was a WordPress site with a paid hosting service. It was my very first entry into content management.</description>
