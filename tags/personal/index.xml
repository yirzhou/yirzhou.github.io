      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been hell of a year&amp;hellip; damn!
I have envisioned a very different year for 2020 back in 2019 - 2020 was supposed to be normal and balanced (again, like all things should be), and yet we had this: a year that might&amp;rsquo;ve already led us into a completely different future. I have come across this thought multiple times: when everything goes back to normal, the perfect term that describes that feeling would be: post-apocalyptic.</description>

      <description>Yet another Christmas, but it is the last Christmas I will be having in Canada. This year&amp;rsquo;s Christmas obviously feels drastically different from the others because of the current world we live in, and I want to capture the feelings I have right now, in case I want to refer back in the future.
Perfect snow This Christmas actually feels like a Christmas in terms of the weather - it started snowing on Christmas Eve and will probably keep snowing for a couple of days.</description>

      <description>This is my first ever article on this site, which means that I&amp;rsquo;m just as new to it as you are ðŸ™‚.
Some history I&amp;rsquo;ve had this idea of writing random stuff down for quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had two failed attempts in the past.
My first attempt was a WordPress site with a paid hosting service. It was my very first entry into content management. However, I found WordPress too much overkill for my use as there are a lot of features that I never used.</description>
