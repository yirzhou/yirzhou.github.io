        <p>The final term at school has been tough to say the least because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am taking <em>seven courses</em>.</li>
<li>I am missing home too much.</li>
<li>I have been rejected by three grad schools that I applied to.</li>
<li>Physically, I am not in a good shape.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two reasons can be coped fairly easily by: studying harder and sleeping less, and distracting myself by reading and watching interesting stuff.</p>
<p>The third reason, however, makes me feel like there could be something inherently wrong with myself. I am fully aware that schools are taking many more applications since the pandemic started; another reason could be that as an engineering student, competing with other computer science students is just too difficult. Or, perhaps I said something in my personal statements that those schools did not like. Regardless, this is a problem that I will probably never get an answer to. I see it as the same as applying for jobs where I would just get straightout rejected or ghosted, which I have already gotten used to.</p>
<p>The last one, well, could just be due to the stress I have been having which made my body more susceptible. I have had two fevers due to potential food poisoning or allergy. I have been recovering and am feeling much better, but the damage has already been done and slowed me down significantly. I have a lot to catch up.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this post is not that positive 😅. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m simply stating the facts, and it could get even worse in a few weeks as we need to crank out our capstone project, stay up late for assignments and projects, and prepare for exams. I still have a couple of schools that haven&rsquo;t released their decisions. Even if I get more offers, I still have a &ldquo;first-world&rdquo; problem to solve - decide where I want to go.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that this is the first time in my life where I feel &ldquo;lost&rdquo;: the decision that I need to make will completely change my life, and yet I am not sure where I want to be which makes the decision process even harder.</p>
<p>Am I being too cautious? I don&rsquo;t consider myself a perfectionist because if I were, I would live miserably and burn out, and have no friend or interests because nothing is perfect. Or, is it because now I need to make these decisions on my own and swallow my own pills completely? Am I chickening out?</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I believe that I will sort everything out.</p>
