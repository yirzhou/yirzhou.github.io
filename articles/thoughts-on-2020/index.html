    <p>It&rsquo;s been hell of a year&hellip; damn!</p>
<p>I have envisioned a very different year for 2020 back in 2019 - 2020 was supposed to be normal and balanced (again, like all things should be), and yet we had this: a year that might&rsquo;ve already led us into a completely different future. I have come across this thought multiple times: when everything goes back to normal, the perfect term that describes that feeling would be: <strong>post-apocalyptic</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on this year, some thoughts that I want to remember and can always learn from in the future.</p>

    Miss
</h2>
<p>A major theme of 2020 for me has been &ldquo;miss&rdquo;, and others seem to agree with me. We all miss the old days where we were together, physically. Although I have terrible social skills and have found a solution to almost every problem, being unable to sbe with others physically has killed me, and I miss that.</p>
<p>More sadly, &ldquo;miss&rdquo; is caused by too MANY <strong>farewells</strong> in 2020. Too many people have lost their family members and friends because of what has happened or just pure bad luck. I vividly remember the feeling of devastation when reading the news of Kobe passing away.</p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s plenty to miss.</em></p>

    WFH alone
</h2>
<p>I am one of the many people who have been working from home this year, and it&rsquo;s actually incredible to think about it.</p>
<p>When things got out of control in March, nobody was well prepared: people were panic-shopping EVERYWHERE; the ongoing school term was ended abruptly; and Spring 2020 sucked.</p>
<p>I was struggling in the beginning of Spring 2020: as an individual who loves &ldquo;order&rdquo;, I was doing a terrible job at managing and scheduling my own tasks, which surprised me. I always felt that my decent self-discipline would come into play seemlessly at a dire time like that, and yet I felt overwhelmed by the high entropy of stuff that kept coming endlessly.</p>
<p>When no one is watching me, or telling me when to do what, I need to think about how to keep myself going. I believe that the best way to achieve that is to make everything <strong>feel like normal</strong>: except for keeping myself at home, I can do exactly the same things that make myself comfortable, and luckily, it worked. In a nutshell, I tried the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organize my courses into a calendar just to feel like I had a real schedule;</li>
<li>Write all deadlines on a whiteboard placed in a noticeable area;</li>
<li>Get a pair of adjustable dumb-bells to not let my body deteriorate;</li>
<li>Study with friends via online conferences, most of the times;</li>
<li>Wake up early to feel good about myself :blush:.</li>
</ol>
<p>One important idea that I realized was that: <em>this is just like the theory of evolution.</em> Those who adapt survive. It sounds nerdy to most people but that&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>

    Surprises
</h2>
<p>What happened and is still happening must be a surprise to everyone, undoubtedly. However, we should be pleasantly surprised by what we accomplished under these circumstances. In a way, this new style of living and working has inspired us to generate new ideas, try new things (baking, cooking, running), and cultivate new habits.</p>
<p>I would say that in terms of my personal achievements, 2020 could be the most prolific year, and I might&rsquo;ve never come to this place if it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>When everything started going down, I considered it perfect for thinking about what to do in the future because I would probably go on a trip after the finals which I couldn&rsquo;t do any more. The time saving was massive for learning something new. I spent two weeks learning a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">new web framework</a> and used it to build a <a href="https://zhouyiren.rocks/">simple web portfolio</a> to put on my resum√©.</p>
<p>More importantly, I didn&rsquo;t want to give up in the job market, which was significantly impacted by the situation. I needed to be &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; if I wanted to be selected since there was no other way, so I made a systematic plan for studying interviews. I started participating in the <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/">LeetCode Monthly Challenge</a> where I get the chance of winning some perk if I complete all 30 questions. I got addicted into it and kept doing it even after I got an internship, which perfectly wrapped up my undergraduate co-op experience. The offer was a surprised, but also somewhat expected: I put much more effort in the preparation than any previous term, and I was lucky to interview with a lot more high-profile companies. I also felt great about every interview, even though some didn&rsquo;t land me offers. Regardless, the one I ended up with was my dream.</p>
<p>I previously mentioned that Spring 2020 <strong>sucked</strong>, and it really did. Nobody was well prepared for it, so the entire term was extremely disorganized. However, I appreciate what they were trying to do and deliver to us, and it has gone a lot better based on what I&rsquo;ve heard recently. The most impressive experience was me staying up all night working on a course project that was due the next day. The course was Distributed Computing - a subject that is inherently obstruse, and the project was just too hard. As the time passed 12AM, I decided to take a break by browsing YouTube&hellip; and voil√†: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2fenSS68JI1h4Fo296JfGr">folklore</a>, the (first-in-2020) surprise album from Taylor Swift went live. So you probably know what happened next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s among the best things in 2020. Putting the unconventional styles exhibited in this album aside, it was a huge surprise to me that came at the right time. The songs helped me get through the toughest times of the year.</p>
<p>I said this before: this new style of living has been a source of inspiration for many that lead to those pleasant surprises. If I solely focused on them, 2020 was my favorite year.</p>

    Post-apocalyptic
</h2>
<p>I have no idea when our life would go back to normal, and what the world would look like. I sometimes naively wonder if it would look like those &ldquo;post-apocalyptic&rdquo; movies or video games.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put out new year&rsquo;s resolution because I really can&rsquo;t think of anything specific at present :sweat_smile:. Regardless, my general objective for 2021 is to live better and achieve more. More importantly, I want to learn from 2020 so that I am better prepared for anything like it.</p>
<p>Peace out, 2020. I&rsquo;ve had a great time with you.</p>
