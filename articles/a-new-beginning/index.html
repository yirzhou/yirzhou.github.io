            <div class="post-content">
                <p>This is my first ever article on this site, which means that I&rsquo;m just as new to it as you are :slightly_smiling_face:.</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this idea of writing random stuff down for quite a while, and I&rsquo;ve had two failed attempts in the past.</p>
<p>My first attempt was a <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> site with a paid hosting service. It was my very first entry into content management. However, I found WordPress too much overkill for my use as there are a lot of features that I never used. Additionally, I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with PHP, which made customization a bit difficult. After two years, I decided to get rid of it.</p>
<p>That leads to my second attempt, which was a <a href="https://zhouyiren.rocks">site</a> built in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> and hosted on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>. It took me just over two weeks to self-teach React and build it during self-quarantine. Firebase provides free hosting which was perfect for getting rid of my old site. I ended up liking React as a frontend framework, and it gave me a taste of frontend development. However, I&rsquo;m never into frontend/UI development, and I felt that it strayed me away from content creation. I did enjoy the learning experience though.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve finally found the <a href="http://gohugo.io/">right tool</a> that allows me to focus on content creation while retaining the high customizability.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-site-exists">Why this site exists</h2>
<p>I believe in the power of taking notes regardless the significance of the matters. Although I consider myself a decent note-taker, I can still get sloppy at times where I will forget the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned. Writting stuff down helps me recall the happy and sad moments or lessons more effectively.</p>
<p>Since this tool allows me to focus on the content aspect, I am determined to start a new page, keep it alive and update it regularly. It mainly serves as a personal space for myself, but if you happen to be close to me in real life, I hope it can convey to you what&rsquo;s going on with my life (I don&rsquo;t browse social media often). If you find the stuff here useful, it will make me even happier :smiley:.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>I will write about topics that I&rsquo;m familiar with. Most of the stuff comes from my experience, whether personally, academically or professionally. Therefore, they are heavily opinion-based and could be against yours. In general, they can be categorized into <strong>technical</strong> and <strong>non-technial</strong> content.</p>
<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<p>You can expect stuff about tools, frameworks of, and tips on software development and productivity. I will try to not make those articles look like technical documentation :sweat_smile:.</p>
<h3 id="non-technical">Non-technical</h3>
<p>You can expect some personal thoughts, perhaps on the issues of the day, life update, and so on.</p>
<p>Regardless the level of technicality, I will attach relevant tags to all articles.</p>
<p>There we go - I just wrote the first article. I have a lot in mind that I want to share with my future self and you, and thanks for visiting my home.</p>
